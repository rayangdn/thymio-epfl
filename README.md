# Mobile Robots Project: Autonomous Navigation and Control

## Overview
This project was developed as part of the **Basics of Mobile Robotics (MICRO-452)** course at EPFL, under the supervision of Professor Francesco Mondada from the [MOBOTS Laboratory](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/mobots/).

### Objectives
We aims to develop an autonomous navigation system for the Thymio robot that can:
1. Navigate through a predefined environment with static obstacles using global navigation
2. Dynamically avoid unexpected obstacles using local navigation
3. Maintain accurate position estimation through filtering
4. Reliably reach arbitrary target positions in the environment

## Demonstration


## Setup Guide

### Prerequisites
- Anaconda or Miniconda installed on your system
- Git (for cloning the repository)
- VSCode with Jupyter extension installed (recommended)

### Installation Steps

#### 1. Environment Setup
Create and activate a new Conda environment with Python 3.12:

```bash
# Create new environment
conda create --name myenv python=3.12

# Activate the environment
conda activate myenv
```

#### 2. Project Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rayangdn/thymio-epfl.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd thymio-epfl
```

#### 3. Open and Run the Notebook
Option 1 (Recommended):

Open the project in VSCode: code .
Open `Group_T46_report.ipynb`
Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook

- Execute cells in sequential order as indicated



Option 2:

Open `Group_T46_report.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
Note: LaTeX formatting may not render correctly in classic Jupyter Notebook

- For better LaTeX rendering, use VSCode


### Additional Resources

- The full project report is included in the notebook
- Code documentation and examples are provided within each section
